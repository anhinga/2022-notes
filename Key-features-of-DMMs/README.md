### Compact and convenient description of the key features of DMMs

Key novel features of dataflow matrix machines (DMM) architecture:

  * Arbitrary linear streams instead of streams of numbers on the level of single neurons. See [Linear streams](1-Linear-streams.md) for details.
  * Arbitrary input and output arity of single neurons. See [Arity of activation functions](2-Arity-of-activation-functions.md).
  * Single neurons can wrap complicated algorithms as activation functions (**super-neurons**). See [Activation functions of super-neurons](3-Activation-functions-of-super-neurons.md).
  * Self-referential (self-modifiable) dynamically expandable networks with unbounded size. See [Self-referential mechanism](4-Self-referential-mechanism.md).
  * DMMs are general purpose **continuously deformable** stream-oriented programs. We hope to use this formalism to create novel methods of program synthesis in the near future. See [DMMs as programs](5-DMMs-as-programs.md).
  * One can think about DMMs as flexible recurrent attention machines. See [DMMs as flexible attention machines](6-DMMs-as-flexible-attention-machines.md).
  * DMMs are modular, hierarchical. They scale from compact networks consisting of several super-neurons and solving simple problems (small continuously deformable programs) to arbitrarily large networks. See [Subnetworks and modularization](7-Subnetworks-and-modularization.md).
