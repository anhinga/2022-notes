# Some non-standard cellular automata

Mostly I am listing work which emerged quite recently, with one exception:

Peter Gacs and probabilistic cellular automata:

"Reliable Cellular Automata with Self-Organization" (2000), https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0003117

Continuous cellular automata (**Lenia** and **Glaberish**):

**Neural cellular automata**, is an amazingly active field of study lately, e.g. see this ICLR 2022 workshop (ICLR materials are now free for general public): 
[From Cells to Societies: Collective Learning Across Scales](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2022/workshop/4553)

For example: [HyperNCA: Growing Developmental Networks with Neural Cellular Automata](https://openreview.net/forum?id=H5eErMka-9)

and [Collective control of modular soft robots via embodied Spiking...](https://openreview.net/forum?id=STGXXBGJ6-c)

Alex Mordvintsev (who created DeepDream in 2015: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepDream 
This is based on taking a pre-trained neural network with fixed weights, 
defining a loss function expressing the intensity of the activity of a subset of this network, 
and taking gradients of this new loss function with respect to the input images).

He did a super-interesting series of studies in **neural cellular automata** in recent years:

[Self Organising Systems](https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/)

- [Growing Neural Cellular Automata](https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/)
- [Self-Organising Textures](https://distill.pub/selforg/2021/textures/)
- Î¼NCA: Texture Generation with Ultra-Compact Neural Cellular Automata, https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13545
