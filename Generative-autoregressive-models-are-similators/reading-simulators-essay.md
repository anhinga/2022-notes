# Reading "Simulators" by janus

The "Simulators" essay is written from the viewpoint of AI alignment/AI safety, and (as usual) the capability boost associated with
better understanding of Transformers and related models is an important aspect of the overall picture.

The two main topics of the essay are

  * Most alignment studies are rather out-of-date because the leading class of models, _generative autoregressive models created by self-supervised pretraining_, is very much unlike the previous leading classes of AI models;

  * _Generative autoregressive models created by self-supervised pretraining_ are **simulators**; one interacts not with these models themselves, but with **simulacra** they create.
