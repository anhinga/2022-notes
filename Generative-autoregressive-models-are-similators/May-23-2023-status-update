# Status update on Janus' Simulator theory

1. There are two relevant sequences on LessWrong:

  * https://www.lesswrong.com/s/N7nDePaNabJdnbXeE (Simulators)
  
  * https://www.lesswrong.com/s/f2YA4eGskeztcJsqT (Cyborgism)
  
2. There is a good deal of disagreement on the status of the Simulator theory

  * People generally believe that it is a great deconfusion tool.
  
  * But they disagree on whether it is literally true, or just a rather imprecise approximation
