Since this is a co-authorship, I think some elements of this paper reflect a compromise between viewpoint differences of the first author and the authors of the Similator theory
(the third and the second author), but I am very happy that the theory of Simulators is becoming mainstream.

I think people who either know Simulator Theory or understand some of it instinctively tend to say correct things about phenomenology of LLMs,
whereas people who don't understand that LLM inference runs create a variety of simulations with varying qualities and properties tend to say all kinds of false things about LLMs.

So I'd like to encourage people to become familiar with this material.
