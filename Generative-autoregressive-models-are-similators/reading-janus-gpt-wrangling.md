# Reading _"Janus' GPT Wrangling"_ by Scott Alexander

Quoting the start of that essay:

```
Janus (pseudonym by request) works at AI alignment startup Conjecture. Their hobby, which is suspiciously similar to their work, is getting GPT-3 to do interesting things.

For example, with the right prompts, you can get stories where the characters become gradually more aware that they are characters being written by some sort of fiction engine, speculate on whatâ€™s going on, and sometimes even make pretty good guesses about the nature of GPT-3 itself.
```
