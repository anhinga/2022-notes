# Reading _"Janus' GPT Wrangling"_ by Scott Alexander

Quoting the start of that essay:

```
Janus (pseudonym by request) works at AI alignment startup Conjecture. Their hobby, which is suspiciously similar to their work,
is getting GPT-3 to do interesting things.

For example, with the right prompts, you can get stories where the characters become gradually more aware that
they are characters being written by some sort of fiction engine, speculate on whatâ€™s going on, and sometimes even make
pretty good guesses about the nature of GPT-3 itself.
```

Then, after a superimpressive quotation from GPT-3:

```
How does it get this level of self-awareness? In this case, via rigged demo. Janus has developed Loom, 
a tool to write with GPT-3 more efficiently. It turns stories into branching trees where you can choose 
which of multiple completions to pick at any given point. 
```

Looking at "Loom: interface to the multiverse", https://generative.ink/posts/loom-interface-to-the-multiverse/

https://github.com/socketteer/loom

we notice that "janus" is the first author of these two papers:

"Multiversal views on language models", https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06391

"Prompt Programming for Large Language Models: Beyond the Few-Shot Paradigm", https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07350
